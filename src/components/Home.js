          You really think you can fly that thing? What do they got in there?
          King Kong? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You're a very
          talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you
          need a manager? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Remind me
          to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but your scientists were so
          preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think
          if they should. Just my luck, no ice. Remind me to thank John for a
          lovely weekend. They're using our own satellites against us. And the
          clock is ticking.
